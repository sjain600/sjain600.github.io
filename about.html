        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am an aspiring data scientist who switched his career from accounting to data science and machine learning.</p>
        
        <p>My journey started in July 2024 when I was interested in learning about AI tools that I could use for my dad's business. Through the recommendation systems of YouTube,
          I came across a YouTube video about building AI tools yourself, and you can start by learning Python, which is an easier language to learn. I had an idea that I should 
          try to learn Python, and see whether I will commit to the learning for a month.</p>
          
        <p>I started learning Python from the book called <em>Python Crash Course</em> by Eric Matthes, which gave great practical experience to apply what I learned. I also took 
          math and statistics courses from Khan Academy. Applying Atomic Habits' key principle of making tiny, consistent changes (1% better daily), I was able to compound the essential skills to continue the pursue of learning
          data science and machine learning models. I took a few courses from Kaggle, such as <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em>, <em>Intermediate Machine Learning</em>, <em>Feature Engineering</em>.
        </p>
          
          <p>Within six months, I gained enough confidence to participate in Kaggle Playground Competitions, which gave me exposure to real-world problems.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I’m diving deep into machine learning, SQL, and data visualization—bridging the gap  between raw data and real-world decisions. 
          Because to me, data isn’t just numbers; it’s a story waiting to be told.</p>
