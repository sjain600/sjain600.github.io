        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I’m an aspiring data scientist who traded balance sheets for XG Boost models. With a foundation in accounting, I bring analytical rigor, attention to detail, 
          and a relentless curiosity to every dataset I explore.</p>
        
        <p>My journey began in July 2024 after a life-changing YouTube video sparked a simple question: 
        <em>“What if I learned Python for just one month?”</em> I picked up <em>Python Crash Course</em> by Eric Matthes—and never looked back. 
        Within three months, I was hooked on coding, and soon realized: Python was just the beginning.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I’m diving deep into machine learning, SQL, and data visualization—bridging the gap  between raw data and real-world decisions. 
          Because to me, data isn’t just numbers; it’s a story waiting to be told.</p>
