        <h2>About me</h2>
        <div class="card">
        
        <p>My journey started in July 2024 when I was interested in learning about AI tools that I could use for my dad's business. I was browsing around various YouTube videos
          about AI tools, prompt engineering, and SEO. Through YouTube's recommendation system, I came across a video about building AI tools from scratch. What caught
          my attention was that I can start this process by learning Python first, which is an easier language to learn. Then I decided to learn Python  and see
          whether I will be able to commit for a month. My whole approach to learning Python was step by step and my aim was practice as much as possible to get better every day.
          </p>
          
        <p>I started learning Python from the book called <em>Python Crash Course</em> by Eric Matthes, which gave great practical experience to apply what I learned. I also took 
          math and statistics courses from Khan Academy. Applying Atomic Habits' key principle of making tiny, consistent changes (1% better daily), I was able to compound the essential skills to continue the pursue of learning
          data science and machine learning models. I took a few courses from Kaggle, such as <em>Intro to Machine Learning</em>, <em>Intermediate Machine Learning</em>, <em>Feature Engineering</em>.
        </p>
          
          <p>Within six months, I gained enough confidence to participate in Kaggle Playground Competitions, which gave me exposure to real-world problems.</p>
        
        <p>Now, I’m diving deep into machine learning, SQL, and data visualization—bridging the gap  between raw data and real-world decisions. 
          Because to me, data isn’t just numbers; it’s a story waiting to be told.</p>
