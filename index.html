    <h1>Shubham Jain: In Progress</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring data scientist who transitioned from accounting, bringing
       a strong numerical and curious mindset to solve data science and ML problems.
    </p>
    <p>My journey started when I was learning AI tools and came across a YouTube video that changed my life.
      It was talking about AI and how I can build my own AI by starting to learn Python, which is a comparatively easier
    language than others. I ponder why not learn Python for a month, and if I don't find it interesting at all, then I will pursue something else.
  </p>
    <p> In July 2024, I decided to learn Python as I was not satisfied with my career as an
      accountant. I started with the book called Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes, which gave me
      a foundational knowledge of Python. Within three months, I gained a lot of momentum and started to
      enjoy coding. I knew that knowing Python is not enough, so I decided to learn about machine learning. I researched 
      the prerequisites to know about my knowledge gap.
