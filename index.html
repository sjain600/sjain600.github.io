    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an aspiring data scientist who transitioned from accounting, bringing
       a strong numerical and curious mindset to solve data science and ML problems.
    </p>
    <p>My journey started when I was learning AI tools and came across a YouTube video which changed my life.
      It was talking about AI and how I can build my own AI, by starting to learn Python which is comparatively easier
    language than others. I ponder that why not learn Python for a month and if don't find it interesting at all, then I pursue something else.
  </p>
    <p> In July 2024, I decided to learn Python as I was not satisfied with my career as an
      accountant. I started with the book called Python Crash Course by Eric Mathes, which gave me
      a foundational knowledge about Python. Within three months, I gained a lot of momentum and started to
      enjoy the coding. I knew knowing Python is not enough so I decided to learn about machine learning. I research about
      the prerequisites to know about my knowledge gap.
